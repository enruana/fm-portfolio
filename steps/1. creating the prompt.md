Tech Stack Details (frontend, backend, database, libraries, tools)
Naming Conventions (directories, files, functions, components, etc.)
Language Usage (specifics about TypeScript, Python, C#, etc., depending on the project)
State Management (if applicable, such as Redux, Context API, hooks, etc.)
UI and Styling (if frontend is relevant: component libraries, CSS frameworks, design systems)
Error Handling (logging, user-facing error messages, retries, etc.)
Testing (unit, integration, E2E, coverage requirements)
Security (authentication, authorization, input sanitization, data handling, compliance)
Version Control and Git Usage (branching strategy, commit message conventions, etc.)
Documentation (README, API references, architecture decisions, diagrams)
Development Workflow (CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, staging/production environments)
If there are any special rules or conventions to explicitly highlight (for example, labeling them as ‘Rule: [short phrase]’), please include them in each relevant section. Also incorporate any additional requirements: [Additional Requirements].

Maintain a formal, instructional tone and use concise bullet points wherever possible. The resulting document should be self-contained and easy to follow by any developer who joins the project.

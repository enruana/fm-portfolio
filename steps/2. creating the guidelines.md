### 2.3 Repository Layout

```
|-- root/
    |-- src/
    |   |-- components/
    |   |   |-- (Reusable UI components)
    |   |-- features/
    |   |   |-- (Feature-specific modules, e.g., blog, contact, portfolio)
    |   |-- pages/
    |   |   |-- (Page-level components for routing)
    |   |-- hooks/
    |   |-- types/
    |   |-- utils/
    |   |-- App.tsx
    |   |-- main.tsx
    |
    |-- public/
    |-- tests/
    |-- package.json
    |-- tsconfig.json
    |-- tailwind.config.js
    |-- README.md
```

### 2.4 Rules

**Rule: Prefer Named Exports**
- Justification: Improves clarity and consistency when importing

**Rule: Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each component or module should do exactly one thing

## 3. Tech Stack Details

### 3.1 Frontend
- ReactJS for building the main UI
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- TypeScript for static typing and improved developer experience
- Shadcn/UI as a component library to accelerate UI development
- ThreeJS and React Three Fiber for 3D graphics and animations in React

### 3.2 Backend
- Currently, no dedicated backend is required
- Static hosting or serverless functions for handling form submissions (e.g., Netlify Functions, AWS Lambda)

### 3.3 Database
- No traditional database at this time
- Blog posts and articles may be fetched from a headless CMS or markdown files in the repository

### 3.4 Additional Libraries and Tools
- React Router (or a suitable routing library) for navigation
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting
- Testing Framework (Jest, React Testing Library) for automated tests

## 4. Naming Conventions

### 4.1 Directories
- **components:** Reusable generic components (e.g., buttons, modals)
- **features:** Group related functionality (e.g., blog, contact)
- **pages:** Page-level components for routing
- **hooks:** Custom React hooks
- **types:** Shared TypeScript interfaces/types
- **utils:** Utility/helper functions

### 4.2 Files
- **Component Files:** ComponentName.tsx (PascalCase)
- **CSS/Style Files:** Typically avoided due to TailwindCSS usage, but if needed, ComponentName.module.css
- **Test Files:** ComponentName.test.tsx or ComponentName.spec.tsx

### 4.3 Functions and Variables
- **Functions:** camelCase (e.g., fetchUserData)
- **React Components:** PascalCase (e.g., UserCard)
- **Variables and Constants:** camelCase for variables, UPPER_CASE for constants

### 4.4 Rules

**Rule: Descriptive Names**
- Avoid abbreviations unless commonly recognized

**Rule: Consistent Casing**
- Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables and functions

## 5. Language Usage

### 5.1 TypeScript
- **Strict Mode:** Enabled to maximize type safety
- **Interfaces vs. Types:**
  - Prefer interface for object shapes
  - Use type for function signatures, unions, and type transformations

### 5.2 Python, C#, or Others
- Currently, no other languages are required
- If serverless functions are used (e.g., Node-based functions), adhere to the same coding conventions (ESLint, Prettier)

### 5.3 Rules

**Rule: Avoid any**
- Always use specific or generic types to ensure correctness

## 6. State Management
- **Local State:** Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for local UI state
- **Context API:** Consider if global state is required (e.g., user context, theme)
- **Redux or Other Libraries:** Use only if the application scales to a point where more robust state management is needed

## 7. UI and Styling

### 7.1 Component Libraries
- Shadcn/UI for pre-styled components
- Customize design tokens in Shadcn/UI to match Felipe's brand if necessary

### 7.2 CSS Framework
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Maintain consistent color palettes, spacing, and typography via tailwind.config.js

### 7.3 Design System
- **Responsive Breakpoints:** Follow Tailwind's default breakpoints
- **Accessibility:** Ensure color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

### 7.4 Rules

**Rule: Use Utility Classes**
- Keep custom CSS minimal and rely on Tailwind utilities for consistency

## 8. Error Handling

### Logging
- In development, use console.error or a logging library
- In production, minimize console logs to reduce clutter

### User-Facing Errors
- Display friendly messages (e.g., "Something went wrong. Please try again.")

### Retries
- Implement limited retries for key network requests if needed

**Rule: Don't Overexpose**
- Avoid showing stack traces or sensitive details in user-facing messages

## 9. Testing

### 9.1 Types of Tests
- **Unit Tests:** For small, isolated components and utility functions
- **Integration Tests:** For components that interact with each other or external services
- **E2E Tests:** (Optional) for full workflow testing, possibly using tools like Cypress or Playwright

### 9.2 Coverage Requirements
- Aim for 80% coverage for critical modules (blog, contact forms, main pages)
- Focus on logic-heavy parts of the code

### 9.3 Rules

**Rule: Test Naming**
- Use descriptive test names that convey the behavior being tested

**Rule: Keep Tests Independent**
- Avoid sharing state or mocking globally where it can cause test interference

## 10. Security

### Authentication/Authorization
- Not required for a public portfolio
- If private admin features are added in the future, use industry-standard protocols (e.g., OAuth)

### Input Sanitization
- Escape or sanitize all user-provided data (contact forms, blog comments)

### Data Handling
- Store minimal user data
- Use secure endpoints or third-party form handlers if necessary

### Compliance
- If collecting personal information, ensure privacy policy compliance (GDPR/CCPA as applicable)

## 11. Version Control and Git Usage

### 11.1 Branching Strategy
- **Main Branch:** Production-ready, stable code
- **Develop Branch:** Consolidates features before merging to main (optional if team size is small)
- **Feature Branches:** One branch per feature or bug fix

### 11.2 Commit Message Conventions
- Use Conventional Commits (e.g., feat: add contact form or fix: resolve layout bug)
- Prefix commits with the type of change (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore)

### 11.3 Rules

**Rule: Frequent Commits**
- Commit early and often for better traceability

**Rule: Write Clear Messages**
- Summarize the change in the subject line (max 50 characters if possible)
- Provide more details in the body when necessary

## 12. Documentation

### 12.1 README
- Brief overview of the project, setup instructions, deployment steps, and references to further documentation

### 12.2 API References
- Not applicable for a primarily frontend project; if using serverless functions, document endpoints in the docs/ folder

### 12.3 Architecture Decisions
- Maintain a simple ADR (Architecture Decision Record) system for significant changes
- Document reasons for choosing certain libraries or approaches (e.g., Shadcn/UI vs. another library)

### 12.4 Diagrams
- Use UML or simple diagrams to illustrate complex flows (e.g., 3D scene rendering pipeline)

## 13. Development Workflow

### 13.1 CI/CD Pipelines

**Continuous Integration**
- Each commit triggers linting, tests, and a build

**Continuous Deployment**
- Deploy to staging or preview environments for testing
- Manual or automatic promotion to production once approved

### 13.2 Code Reviews
- Required for all merges into main (or develop) branch
- Check code quality, readability, performance, and security considerations

### 13.3 Environments
- **Local Development:** npm run dev or yarn dev for local server
- **Staging Environment:** For final verification of features
- **Production Environment:** Publicly accessible site

## 14. Additional Requirements

### SEO
- Use relevant meta tags and implement SSR or prerendering where beneficial

### Performance Optimization
- Code splitting, lazy loading for 3D assets, image optimization

### Analytics
- Optionally integrate Google Analytics or a privacy-friendly analytics solution to track user engagement
